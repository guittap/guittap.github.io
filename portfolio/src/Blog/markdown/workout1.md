Welcome to my workout blog! I have been trying to work out on a regular basis for almost a year now and I finally decided to document my progression.

### Progression Before Pandemic

One of the biggest issues with starting a workout blog in this time is that all of the gyms are closed. I need to go off of my progression with my body weight exercises, but that doesn't mean I can't go back and document my progression pre-pandemic.

#### Weight Training Max

| Workout  |     | Weight |     | Reps |
| -------- | --- | ------ | --- | ---- |
| bench    |     | 125    |     | 2    |
| squat    |     | 155    |     | 5    |
| deadlift |     | 245    |     | 1    |

#### My Goal

| Workout  |     | Weight |     | Reps |
| -------- | --- | ------ | --- | ---- |
| bench    |     | 155    |     | 1    |
| squat    |     | 225    |     | 1    |
| deadlift |     | 315    |     | 1    |

Those were my maxes for the big three weight training workouts. My current goal is to bench my body weight, squat 1.5x my body weight, and deadlift 2x my body weight. I am currently at 150lbs.

I worked out seven days a week usually after 17:30 (when I got out of class most days). I didn't really have a specific diet, I just ate what I wanted. I followed the usual push -> pull -> legs and I tried to go easy by only doing 3 different workouts per session.

#### 🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️ Push

| Workout |     | Weight     |     | Reps |     | Sets |
| ------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| bench   |     | 95-115     |     | 8-10 |     | 3    |
| dips    |     | bodyweight |     | 5-8  |     | 3    |
| OHP     |     | 45-75      |     | 7-10 |     | 3    |

#### 🦾🦾 Pull

| Workout  |     | Weight     |     | Reps |     | Sets |
| -------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| deadlift |     | 95-225     |     | 8-10 |     | 3    |
| pullup   |     | bodyweight |     | 3-5  |     | 3    |
| row      |     | 55-90      |     | 8-10 |     | 3    |

#### 🦵🦵 Legs

| Workout     |     | Weight |     | Reps |     | Sets |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| squat       |     | 95-135 |     | 8-10 |     | 3    |
| lunges      |     | 45-105 |     | 8-10 |     | 3    |
| calf raises |     | 45     |     | 8-10 |     | 3    |

I plan on making these blogs as consistently as I can. I should be making a blog at least once a week if not twice a week. The next blog will be about my at home work out regimen and my progress with body weight workouts. I also might add some videos of my form in the next blog, but only time will tell.
